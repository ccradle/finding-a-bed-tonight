## [v0.24.0] — 2026-04-01 — Offline Honesty

### Fixed
- **Offline banner lied**: "Actions will sync when connection returns" was false — only shelter creation queued offline. Bed holds and availability updates silently failed. Replaced with honest copy: "Bed holds and updates will be queued and sent when you reconnect."
- **`replayQueue()` never called**: The offline queue existed but nothing triggered replay on reconnect. Now wired to the `online` DOM event with jittered delay.
- **Misleading Playwright offline tests**: Tests used `context.setOffline()` which does NOT fire DOM events or change `navigator.onLine`. All tests now explicitly dispatch `online`/`offline` events.
- **React hook ordering crash in production build**: `fetchReservations` referenced before initialization in minified bundle. Found via Playwright trace analysis — invisible in Vite dev mode.
- **nginx missing CORP header**: Static assets lacked `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`, breaking the app when `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp` was set. Found via nginx E2E testing.

### Added
- **Offline queue wired to bed holds and availability updates**: Darius's test ("hold a bed, lose signal, come back online — what happened to my hold?") now passes. Actions enqueue to IndexedDB when offline or when online requests fail (try/catch fallback for `navigator.onLine` lies).
- **Single-queue architecture**: Removed Workbox BackgroundSyncPlugin. App-level IndexedDB queue is the sole retry mechanism — fully testable, works on all browsers including hospital locked-down Chrome. See design.md for rationale.
- **Idempotency key deduplication**: `X-Idempotency-Key` header on POST /reservations. Backend returns existing hold (200) instead of creating duplicate (201). Flyway V30 adds `idempotency_key` column.
- **Queue status indicator**: Badge in header shows pending queued action count. Click to see details. Disappears after replay.
- **6-state UI for queued actions**: QUEUED (amber clock), SENDING (spinner), CONFIRMED (transitions to countdown), CONFLICTED (red "bed taken"), EXPIRED (gray), FAILED (amber retry).
- **Reconnect jitter**: 0-2 second random delay before replay to prevent thundering herd when shelter WiFi reconnects.
- **Concurrent replay guard**: Module-level lock + synchronous Layout guard prevent duplicate replay from rapid `online` events.
- **Persistent storage request**: `navigator.storage.persist()` at startup protects IndexedDB from browser eviction.
- **Custom service worker**: Switched from `generateSW` to `injectManifest`. SW handles precaching and NetworkFirst GET caching only (no BackgroundSync).
- **15 Vitest unit tests** for offlineQueue.ts: expiry boundaries, conflict handling, concurrent guard, idempotency key uniqueness.
- **14 Playwright E2E tests through nginx**: offline banner, queue/replay, hold flow, expiry, conflict, double-event guard, try/catch fallback, multi-action order, FAILED state, toast notification, hospital SW-blocked.
- **5 Gatling performance scenarios**: concurrent replay (p95=260ms), idempotent dedup (p95=55ms), mixed storm (0% errors), shelter WiFi outage 10 users (p95=304ms), citywide ISP outage 20 users (p95=298ms).

### Changed
- Backend version: 0.23.0 → 0.24.0
- Flyway migrations: 29 → 30 (V30: `idempotency_key` on `reservation`)
- Test counts: 328 backend (+3 idempotency), 188 Playwright (+14 offline, -4 old), 15 Vitest unit (new), 7 Gatling simulations (+1)
- vite-plugin-pwa strategy: `generateSW` → `injectManifest`
- FOR-COORDINATORS.md: honest offline claims
- nginx.conf: added `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` on static assets

---

## [v0.23.0] — 2026-03-31 — SSE Stability & Cache Fix

### Fixed
- **SSE notification stream causing page refresh**: SseEmitter 5-minute timeout caused periodic disconnects, each triggering full data refetch. Changed to -1L (no timeout) with 20-second heartbeat-based dead connection detection.
- **Stale data after shelter edit**: Workbox `StaleWhileRevalidate` served cached API responses after PUT, showing old phone numbers and settings. Changed to `NetworkFirst` with 5-second timeout — users always see fresh data after saves.
- **Misleading offline test**: Removed Playwright test that asserted "page doesn't crash" as proof of offline queue replay. Real queue tests will come in the offline-honesty change.
- **Test isolation**: Coordinator dashboard/beds/availability-math tests targeted specific shelter by name instead of fragile "first shelter" index.

### Added
- **SSE Last-Event-ID replay buffer**: Server maintains 100 most recent events (5-minute window). On reconnect, replays only missed events filtered by tenant and DV access. Sends `refresh` event if gap too large.
- **@microsoft/fetch-event-source**: Replaces native EventSource. Auth via Authorization header (eliminates query-param token leak), exponential backoff with jitter on reconnect, auto-close when tab backgrounded (Page Visibility).
- **SSE Micrometer metrics**: `sse.connections.active` gauge, `sse.reconnections.total` counter, `sse.event.delivery.duration` timer, `sse.send.failures.total` counter.
- **Grafana SSE health panels**: Reconnection Rate and Send Failures panels in FABT Operations dashboard.
- **SseStabilityTest**: 4 backend integration tests (timeout behavior, initial event format, Last-Event-ID replay, metrics registration).
- **SseTokenFilter deprecation warning**: Logs WARN when query-param token auth is used for SSE.
- **Graceful shutdown**: `@PreDestroy` closes all SSE emitters, triggering immediate client reconnection.
- `test.describe.serial` for import lifecycle tests (dependent test ordering enforced).
- Color-system tests migrated from CDN axe-core injection to `@axe-core/playwright` AxeBuilder (CSP-compatible).

### Changed
- Heartbeat: 30-second SSE comments → 20-second named events with `id:` (advances Last-Event-ID for accurate replay)
- Backend version: 0.22.0 → 0.23.0
- Test counts: 325 backend (+4), 174 Playwright (-1 misleading test removed, +2 SSE connectivity)

---

## [v0.22.2] — 2026-03-30 — Nginx Dev Parity

### Added
- `--nginx` flag on `dev-start.sh`: serves frontend through the real nginx proxy (port 8081) instead of Vite dev server, catching proxy-specific bugs before they reach production
- `--no-build` flag: restart nginx without rebuilding frontend (quick nginx.conf iteration)
- `docker-compose.dev-nginx.yml`: dev override with volume-mounted nginx container using `host-gateway` for backend connectivity
- Playwright `nginx` project: run full E2E suite through nginx (`NGINX=1 npx playwright test --project=nginx`)
- SSE connectivity test (`sse-connectivity.spec.ts`): verifies notification stream stays connected 15+ seconds without reconnecting — would have caught the v0.22.1 SSE buffering bug
- CORS auto-configuration: `--nginx` mode sets `FABT_CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to include both Vite (:5173) and nginx (:8081) origins
- FOR-DEVELOPERS.md: "Testing with nginx proxy" section with usage guidance

### Changed
- `dev-start.sh stop` now also cleans up nginx dev container
- Playwright config uses `NGINX=1` env var to opt-in to nginx project (keeps default runs on Vite only)

---

## [v0.22.1] — 2026-03-30 — SSE Proxy Fix

### Fixed
- **SSE notification stream broken through nginx proxy**: The frontend container's nginx was buffering SSE responses, causing the EventSource to disconnect and reconnect every ~5 seconds. Each reconnect triggered a full refetch of bed search results and DV referrals, creating constant page refreshing. Added dedicated SSE proxy location with `proxy_buffering off`, `proxy_cache off`, and `proxy_read_timeout 86400s`.
- **catchUp storm on SSE reconnect**: Every `onerror` on the EventSource fired `catchUp()` which dispatched refetch events with no cooldown. Added 30-second debounce to prevent API hammering during flaky connectivity.

---

## [v0.22.0] — 2026-03-30 — Import Hardening

### Fixed
- **Import navigation bug**: Admin panel import links used `<a href="/import/211">` — a full page navigation to a non-existent route. Replaced with React Router `<Link to="/coordinator/import/211">`. The 211 and HSDS import buttons were completely broken for all users.
- **CSV injection (CWE-1236)**: Imported CSV and JSON data was stored unsanitized. A malicious `=CMD('calc')` in a shelter name would execute when exported and opened in Excel. New `CsvSanitizer` strips dangerous `=`, `+`, `@` prefixes while preserving legitimate patterns (`+1-919-555-0100`, `-123 Main St`). Applied to both 211 CSV and HSDS JSON import paths.
- **Headers-only CSV**: Importing a CSV with only headers and no data rows silently proceeded to preview. Now shows "no data rows" error immediately after preview.

### Added
- MIME type validation on import endpoints (rejects non-CSV/JSON uploads)
- Field length validation on all imported fields (matches DB column sizes, row-level errors)
- 18 `CsvSanitizer` unit tests (`@ParameterizedTest`)
- 7 negative backend integration tests (empty file, headers-only, malformed CSV, injection, field length, missing column)
- 3 Playwright E2E negative tests (empty file, headers-only, injection sanitization)
- 1 Playwright admin panel click-through test (the test that would have caught the navigation bug)

---

## [v0.21.0] — 2026-03-29 — Color System, Dark Mode, HIC/PIT FY2024+, Training Materials

### Added
- **Color system**: 30 semantic color tokens as CSS custom properties in `global.css`, shared TypeScript constants in `colors.ts`. Follows Radix/Carbon split pattern: `primaryText` for links/labels, `primary` for button fills — resolves the dark mode dual-contrast problem.
- **Dark mode**: System-only `prefers-color-scheme: dark` support across all views. No manual toggle. Dark palette sourced from Carbon Design System (Blue-60/40, Green-40, Red-40, Yellow-30). `color-scheme: light dark` for native dark scrollbars and form controls.
- **HIC export rewrite**: Matches HUD Inventory.csv schema (FY2024+) — 17 columns, integer codes for all coded fields (HouseholdType 1/3/4, ProjectType 0, Availability 1, ESBedType 1). Veteran bed breakdown columns (CHVet/YouthVet/Vet/CHYouth/Youth/CH/Other). CoCCode, InventoryID, InventoryStartDate. DV aggregate row with small-cell suppression.
- **PIT export update**: Integer codes for ProjectType (0) and HouseholdType (1/3/4). Code comment documents HDX 2.0 submission note.
- **Training materials**: Coordinator quick-start card (print-ready HTML, front: 5-step flow, back: 5 troubleshooting scenarios). Admin onboarding checklist (fillable, per-shelter). Freshness badge tooltips on DataAge component (4 i18n keys EN/ES).
- **Freshness tooltips**: Hover/focus on freshness badges shows plain-language guidance ("Over 8 hours old. Call the shelter before driving there.")
- Playwright TDD test guards: axe-core contrast scan in dark mode, source-level hex grep (501→0), light mode regression guard
- Playwright E2E: click Download HIC/PIT → receive file → validate HUD schema content
- 6 new backend integration tests (HIC row-by-row validation, CSV round-trip, unknown type rejection, DV suppression boundary)

### Changed
- **18 component files migrated** from 501 hardcoded hex values to semantic `color.*` tokens (OAuth provider brand colors excluded)
- HIC CSV columns use HUD integer codes instead of strings (HouseholdType: "Families" → 3)
- `mapHouseholdTypeCode()` throws on unknown population types (was silent pass-through)
- HMIS vendor endpoints return 501 (was fake 200 success)
- WCAG-ACR updated to note dark mode coverage
- SPM mapping doc updated for HIC FY2024+ schema

### Fixed
- **Download bug**: `<a href download>` doesn't send JWT auth headers — changed to `fetch()` + blob download in AnalyticsTab. HIC/PIT downloads were broken for all users.
- 4 pre-existing typography drift fixes (NotificationBell, UserEditDrawer) — hardcoded px → tokens

---

## [v0.20.0] — 2026-03-29 — Shelter Edit & Import/Export Hardening

### Added
- **Shelter edit mode**: ShelterForm supports create and edit via `initialData` prop. PUT on save for edit, POST for create. Route: `/coordinator/shelters/:id/edit`.
- **Edit navigation**: "Edit" link on each Admin Shelters tab row, "Edit Details" button on Coordinator dashboard expanded card. `?from=` param for return navigation.
- **DV shelter safeguards**: `dvShelter` field on `UpdateShelterRequest`. COC_ADMIN+ can change DV flag (403 for COORDINATOR). Confirmation dialog on true→false with "Remove DV Protection?" warning. All DV flag and address changes audit-logged via `audit_events`.
- **Demo 211 import → edit flow**: `e2e/fixtures/nc-211-sample.csv` (3 fictitious NC shelters with iCarol-style headers). Playwright e2e tests for full lifecycle.
- **GitHub Pages**: `demo/shelter-onboarding.html` — 7-card walkthrough (import → edit → DV safeguards). "Shelter Onboarding" link in main walkthrough footer. 7 new screenshots (20-26).
- **Import preview contract fix**: `POST /api/v1/import/211/preview` now accepts file upload (was GET with headerLine). Returns `{columns: [{sourceColumn, targetField, sampleValues}], totalRows, unmapped}` matching frontend.
- **Apache Commons CSV**: Replaced hand-rolled CSV parser. Handles UTF-8 BOM, RFC 4180 escaped quotes, embedded newlines.
- **Coordinate validation**: Import sanitizes lat/lng outside valid ranges (-90..90, -180..180) to null with warning log.
- **File upload size limit**: `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size=10MB`. `MaxUploadSizeExceededException` → 413 response.
- **CSV injection protection**: `HicPitExportService.escCsv()` tab-prefixes cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` per OWASP guidance.
- 8 backend integration tests (DV safeguards: coordinator phone edit, DV flag 403, COC_ADMIN DV change, unassigned shelter 403; CSV edge cases: BOM, escaped quotes, invalid coordinates; file size limit)
- 4 Playwright e2e tests (admin edit name, coordinator edit phone, DV toggle, DV confirmation dialog)
- 3 Playwright demo lifecycle tests (import → phone edit → DV flag)
- 25 i18n keys (EN/ES) for shelter edit + import pages

### Changed
- `ImportResultResponse.errors` is now `List<String>` (human-readable "Row N: field — message") instead of `int` count. Frontend contract aligned.
- `ImportLogResponse` fields renamed: `createdCount` → `created`, `updatedCount` → `updated`, `skippedCount` → `skipped`, `errorCount` → `errors`. Frontend contract aligned.
- HMIS vendor endpoints (`/api/v1/hmis/vendors`) marked `@Deprecated(forRemoval=true)`, return 501 instead of fake success.
- Card 11 caption in demo walkthrough updated to mention edit and import capability.

### Fixed
- **Import preview endpoint**: Was `GET` with `headerLine` query param but frontend sent `POST` with file upload. Now `POST` matching frontend contract.
- **Import result crash**: Frontend expected `errors: string[]` but backend returned `errors: int`. Import success page would show `[object Object]`.
- **Import history blank values**: Frontend expected `created/updated/skipped` but backend returned `createdCount/updatedCount/skippedCount`.
- Typography drift: 4 hardcoded font sizes in `NotificationBell.tsx` and `UserEditDrawer.tsx` replaced with typography tokens.

---

## [v0.19.0] — 2026-03-29 — Admin User Management

### Added
- User edit drawer: slide-out panel from admin Users table — display name, email, roles (multi-select), dvAccess toggle
- User deactivation: soft-delete with `status` field (ACTIVE/DEACTIVATED), confirmation dialog, admin can reactivate
- JWT token versioning: `ver` claim in JWT, `token_version` column on app_user. Incremented on role change, dvAccess change, deactivation, reactivation. Existing JWTs immediately invalidated.
- Audit trail: `audit_events` table (V29) with BRIN index. Records: ROLE_CHANGED, USER_DEACTIVATED, USER_REACTIVATED, DV_ACCESS_CHANGED, PASSWORD_RESET. Query endpoint: `GET /api/v1/audit-events?targetUserId={id}`
- `UserService` extracted from controller (tech debt — business logic was in controller layer)
- `NotificationService.completeEmitter(userId)` — disconnects SSE on user deactivation
- ArchUnit boundary rule for notification module (22 rules total)
- Deactivated user in seed data (former@dev.fabt.org) for screenshots
- 5 backend integration tests (role edit, deactivate, JWT rejection, audit persistence, reactivate)
- 7 Playwright e2e tests (drawer, edit, deactivate confirm, status badge, Escape, dialog role)
- 11 i18n keys (EN/ES) for user management

### Changed
- `UserResponse` includes `status` field
- `UpdateUserRequest` includes `email` field
- Login rejects deactivated users with "Account deactivated. Contact your administrator."
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter` checks user status + token version before password-change timestamp
- `shared.audit` package with proper ArchUnit boundaries (api, repository sub-packages)

### Fixed
- Playwright test pollution: user-management tests no longer modify seed user roles (edits deactivated test user instead)

---

## [v0.18.1] — 2026-03-29 — SSE Emitter Cleanup Fix

### Fixed
- SSE emitter cleanup double-decrement: Spring fires `onCompletion` after `onTimeout`/`onError`, causing the `activeConnections` gauge to go negative (-234 observed). Guard with `emitters.remove()` return value for idempotent cleanup.
- Cascading SSE send failures on `availability.updated` events eliminated — dead emitters no longer accumulate in the map.
- Gatling AvailabilityUpdate KO rate: 14.1% → 2.05% (remaining 8 are expected 409 Conflict from same-shelter concurrent writes).

---

## [v0.18.0] — 2026-03-29 — SSE Real-Time Notifications

### Added
- Server-Sent Events endpoint: `GET /api/v1/notifications/stream?token=<jwt>` with per-user SseEmitter, tenant-scoped event filtering, 30s keepalive heartbeat
- `NotificationService`: ConcurrentHashMap emitter management, `@EventListener` for DomainEvent dispatch, Spring #33421/#33340 callbacks
- `SseTokenFilter`: JWT extraction from query parameter for EventSource API limitation (standard approach per GitHub, Slack)
- `NotificationController` with `@Operation` annotation for MCP discoverability
- SecurityConfig rule for SSE endpoint, filter chain ordering (JWT → SSE → API key)
- Notification bell UI: WAI-ARIA disclosure pattern (`aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, Escape-to-close, focus management)
- Connection status banner: Slack disconnect-only model, `role="status"` + `aria-live="polite"`, 3s reconnected toast
- `useNotifications` hook: EventSource connection, window custom events for page-level auto-refresh
- Auto-refresh: OutreachSearch refreshes referral list on `dv-referral.responded`, bed search on `availability.updated`
- Person-centered i18n: "A shelter accepted your referral" (not "Referral response received"), 15 keys EN/ES
- Micrometer metrics: `fabt.sse.connections.active` gauge, `fabt.sse.events.sent.count` counter (tagged by eventType)
- Grafana: SSE Active Connections gauge + Events Sent rate panels on operations dashboard
- Gatling `SseSearchConcurrentSimulation`: concurrent SSE + bed search load test (p99=116ms with 20 SSE connections)
- 5 backend integration tests (HttpClient.sendAsync wire-level DV safety assertion)
- 13 Playwright e2e tests (bell visibility, WCAG disclosure, Escape-to-close, connection status)
- 3 dedicated notification screenshot captures
- Runbook: SSE architecture, metrics, troubleshooting (proxy blocking, connection accumulation)
- `SchedulingConfig`: `@EnableScheduling` gated by `fabt.scheduling.enabled` property (disabled in tests)
- Testcontainers PostgreSQL `max_connections=200` for multi-context test safety

### Changed
- DV referral demo caption: "Darius's notification bell lights up instantly" (was "when Darius refreshes")
- `@EnableScheduling` moved from Application.java to dedicated SchedulingConfig (ConditionalOnProperty)
- Virtual screen reader test: added `globalThis.CSS` polyfill for @guidepup/virtual-screen-reader

### Fixed
- SSE integration tests: `HttpClient.shutdownNow()` + `awaitTermination()` + `NotificationService.completeAll()` prevent Tomcat shutdown hang and JDBC pool exhaustion
- `@Scheduled` DV canary firing on test context startup, exhausting HikariCP pool (gated by property)
- Accessibility scan: ConnectionStatusBanner green toast contrast ratio 3.76:1→5.48:1 (#047857)

---

## [v0.17.0] — 2026-03-28 — Story-Aligned Seed Data + Observability

### Added
- 13-shelter Wake County CoC network (was 10): 3 family, 3 DV, 7 general/specialized
- Day-in-the-life seed data timestamps: Crabtree Valley ~12min, Capital Blvd ~10min, New Beginnings ~7min
- 28-day demo activity with deterministic metrics: 47 zero-result searches on target Tuesday, upward utilization trend (72%→85%, avg ~78%), reservation conversion trending 65%→80%
- `infra/scripts/seed-reset.sql`: clears all seed data for fresh reload
- `dev-start.sh --fresh`: runs seed-reset.sql before loading seed data
- `e2e/playwright/helpers/test-cleanup.ts`: shared `cleanupTestData()` utility
- `afterAll` cleanup in 6 Playwright test files (admin-panel, password-change, admin-password-reset, dv-referral, outreach-search, coordinator-dashboard)
- TestResetController: now also deletes test-created users (email patterns: pwdtest-*, e2e-*, test-*)
- `publishPercentileHistogram()` on bed search, availability update, and webhook delivery timers
- Availability update timer: `fabt.availability.update.duration` with histogram buckets
- 3 new Grafana operations panels (10→13): Bed Search Latency p50/p95/p99, Availability Update Latency, HikariCP Connection Acquire Time
- `data-testid` on shelter cards in OutreachSearch for reliable Playwright locators
- "Language and Values" section in README
- Cost savings quantification in FOR-FUNDERS.md ($31,545/person, NAEH Housing First source linked)

### Changed
- Walkthrough restructured: bed search at position 1 (was login), split into 4 parts (Darius's Night / Behind the Scenes / Operations / Trust), 19→15 screenshots
- Trust/proof closing section: WCAG ACR, DV privacy, Apache 2.0, deployment tiers
- Audience-specific CTAs: For Funders, For City Officials, For Developers
- Capture scripts: select FAMILY_WITH_CHILDREN filter, click Crabtree Valley by data-testid
- Analytics captions: removed specific numbers that didn't match 30-day dashboard view
- DV referral caption: "notified instantly" corrected to "refreshes referral list" (no notification mechanism)
- Person-first language: 7 instances fixed across both repos
- Karate test shelter IDs updated for new structure (DV 009→011, availability 001→004)

### Fixed
- WCAG color-contrast: Call button #059669→#047857 (3.76:1→5.48:1)
- Spring Batch 6 sequence names in demo-activity-seed.sql (BATCH_JOB_SEQ→batch_job_instance_seq)
- Target Tuesday calculation in demo-activity-seed.sql (was producing Sunday)
- Grafana datasource UID mismatch on new panels

---

## [v0.16.0] — 2026-03-28 — Self-Service Password Management

### Added
- `PUT /api/v1/auth/password` — self-service password change (current + new, min 12 chars per NIST 800-63B)
- `POST /api/v1/users/{id}/reset-password` — admin-initiated password reset (COC_ADMIN/PLATFORM_ADMIN, same-tenant)
- JWT invalidation via `password_changed_at` timestamp — tokens issued before password change are rejected
- SSO-only users return 409 Conflict (no local password to change)
- Rate limiting: 5/15min password change, 10/15min admin reset (bucket4j + Caffeine JCache)
- Micrometer metrics: `fabt.auth.password_change.count`, `fabt.auth.password_reset.count`, `fabt.auth.token_invalidated.count`
- Change Password modal (header button, all roles), Admin Reset Password button per user row
- 24 i18n keys (EN + ES), Flyway V27, `@Operation` annotations for MCP
- 11 backend integration tests, 4 Playwright e2e tests, OWASP ZAP scan (0 new findings)
- Login form `data-testid` attributes for reliable Playwright locators

### Fixed
- JWT `iat` vs `password_changed_at` sub-second precision mismatch (truncate to seconds)
- False pilot/deployment claims removed from FOR-FUNDERS.md, sustainability-narrative.md

## [v0.15.3] — 2026-03-28 — README Restructure + Raw Enum Fix

README slimmed from 1,300 to 123 lines with 5 audience-specific pages. Raw API enum values removed from all user-facing display text.

### Added
- 5 audience-specific documentation pages: FOR-COORDINATORS, FOR-COC-ADMINS, FOR-CITIES, FOR-DEVELOPERS (full technical reference), FOR-FUNDERS
- `populationTypeLabels.ts` shared utility — maps API enum values to i18n display labels with multi-language support
- 2 Playwright "raw enum prevention" tests — scan visible text as admin for any raw API enum values across all views

### Fixed
- 8 locations displaying raw `DV_SURVIVOR`, `SINGLE_ADULT` etc. as visible text — now use i18n labels with full Spanish translation
- CVE-2026-34043: serialize-javascript 7.0.4 → 7.0.5 (medium severity, CPU exhaustion DoS)

### Changed
- README restructured: parking lot story first, "No more midnight phone calls," audience routing within 25 lines
- All technical content preserved in `docs/FOR-DEVELOPERS.md` (1,175 lines)

### Tests
- 124 Playwright (+2 raw enum prevention), 256 backend, 26 Karate — all green

**Diff:** [v0.15.2...v0.15.3](https://github.com/ccradle/finding-a-bed-tonight/compare/v0.15.2...v0.15.3)

## [v0.15.2] — 2026-03-28 — Dignity-Centered Copy

User-facing labels reviewed through Keisha Thompson (AI persona, Lived Experience) and Simone Okafor (AI persona, Brand Strategist) lenses.

### Changed
- Population type filter: "DV Survivors" → "Safety Shelter" (EN) / "Refugio Seguro" (ES) — protects client dignity when outreach worker's screen is visible. Internal enum `DV_SURVIVOR` unchanged.
- `DataAge` component refactored from hardcoded strings to i18n — freshness badges now translate to Spanish
- Offline banner: added "your last search is still available" reassurance
- Error messages humanized: "Failed to load shelters" → "Couldn't reach shelter data. Check your connection and try again." (EN + ES)

### Tests
- 4 new Playwright copy-dignity tests (Safety Shelter dropdown, no-DV-terminology, freshness age, Spanish locale)
- 122 total Playwright, 256 backend, 26 Karate — all green

**Diff:** [v0.15.1...v0.15.2](https://github.com/ccradle/finding-a-bed-tonight/compare/v0.15.1...v0.15.2)

## [v0.15.1] — 2026-03-27 — Typography System + Lint Cleanup

Centralized typography system with CSS custom properties, consistent font rendering across all platforms, and zero ESLint errors.

### Added
- `global.css`: system font stack (`system-ui`), CSS custom properties for font sizes/weights/line-heights, universal font-family inheritance, base line-height 1.5 (WCAG 1.4.12)
- `typography.ts`: shared TypeScript constants referencing CSS custom properties — single source of truth for all typography
- Monospace fallback chain: `ui-monospace, Cascadia Code, Source Code Pro, Menlo, Consolas, Courier New`
- 4 Playwright typography tests: font consistency, no-serif verification, form element inheritance, WCAG 1.4.12 text spacing override

### Changed
- All 13 component files migrated from hardcoded font values to `var()` token references
- All `fontFamily: 'monospace'` replaced with `var(--font-mono)` (proper fallback chain)
- WCAG-ACR updated: criteria 1.4.4 and 1.4.12 now reference typography system + automated Playwright verification
- Government adoption guide updated: design token system noted in WCAG posture

### Fixed
- 16 pre-existing ESLint errors resolved (AuthContext window mutation, AuthGuard export, Layout route announcement, SessionTimeoutWarning Date.now purity, AdminPanel `any` types, AnalyticsTab catch types, OutreachSearch dep array)
- 2 fragile Playwright selectors replaced with `data-testid` (admin-panel API key reveal, outreach-search freshness badge)
- `AdminPanel.tsx`: 3 `any` types replaced with proper `HmisStatus`/`HmisVendorStatus` interfaces + null safety fixes

### Tests
- 256 backend, 118 Playwright (+4 typography), 26 Karate — all green
- ESLint: 0 errors (was 16)
- TypeScript: 0 errors

**Diff:** [v0.15.0...v0.15.1](https://github.com/ccradle/finding-a-bed-tonight/compare/v0.15.0...v0.15.1)

## [v0.15.0] — 2026-03-27 — Security Hardening Pre-Pilot

Security hardening based on Marcus Webb AI persona (AppSec) static review. 12 findings addressed, 20 new security tests, OWASP ZAP baseline established.

### Added
- JWT startup validation: `@PostConstruct` rejects empty, short, or default-dev secret with actionable error message
- Universal exception handler: catch-all with Micrometer counter (`fabt.error.unhandled.count`), honors `@ResponseStatus` annotations
- Access denied handler: 403 with `fabt.http.access_denied.count` metric (role + path_prefix tags)
- Not-found handler: 404 with `fabt.http.not_found.count` metric (path_prefix tag for endpoint probing detection)
- Security headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy (Spring Security DSL + nginx defense-in-depth)
- Auth rate limiting: bucket4j, 10 req / 15 min per IP on login/refresh (disabled in lite profile for Karate compatibility)
- Rate limit logging: custom `RateLimitLoggingFilter` — WARN with client IP (bucket4j has no built-in logging)

- Multi-tenant: verified no cross-contamination under 100 concurrent virtual thread requests (CountDownLatch barrier)
- Connection pool: verified `applyRlsContext()` correctly resets `app.dv_access` on every connection checkout

### Tests
